# ImageToHtml
ImageToHtml is a frontend project that recreates a given design image into a pixel-perfect HTML layout using pure CSS. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how static UI designs can be transformed into clean, responsive, and well-structured web code without relying on external frameworks or libraries.
