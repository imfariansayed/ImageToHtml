# ImageToHtml (Python)

This is a small Python project that turns an image into an HTML file using **pure CSS**.
No canvas. No SVG. No frameworks.
Just **one div** and a *crazy amount of `box-shadow`*.

Yes, it actually works.

---

## What this does

* Takes an image
* Reads every pixel
* Converts each pixel into a CSS `box-shadow`
* Outputs a single HTML file
* Displays the image using **only HTML + CSS**

Browser does the rest (and suffers a little).
